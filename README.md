# DNA-Cryptography
DNA Cryptography can be defined as a hiding data in terms of DNA Sequence. DNA cryptography is one of the rapid emerging technology which works on concepts of DNA computing. A new technique for securing data was introduced using the biological structure of DNA called DNA Computing (aka  molecular computing or biological computing). DNA can be used to store and transmit data. The concept of using DNA computing in the fields of cryptography and steganography has been identified as a possible technology that may bring forward a new hope for unbreakable algorithms. Strands of DNA are long polymers of millions of linked nucleotides. These nucleotides consist of one of four nitrogen bases, a five carbon sugar and a phosphate group. The nucleotides that make up these polymers are named after the nitrogen base that it consists of; Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G) and Thymine (T).
